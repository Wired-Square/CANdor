## [0.2.29] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed

- **Decoder**: Fixed stale session restart when switching IO profiles. When switching from one GVRET endpoint to another, the old session was incorrectly being restarted due to a stale closure capturing the previous session ID. The Decoder now correctly relies on the backend's auto-start behavior after reinitializing a session.
